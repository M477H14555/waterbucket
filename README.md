## How to play? > 
  To be honest, this was a different version of what I played in the past but anyways. you're here mfor the instructions.
  
  You start off with 5L of water in a 8L container and you have to make 4L of water somehow. There are 3 comntainers, an 8L, 5L and a 3L. 
  
  You can do all sorts of things with the containers such as:
  
  Filling them up with water
  Emptying them out
  Pour water to one another
  Or quit
  
  [These actions can be triggered by typing in the first letter of the command (Pour water = "P")]
  
  BTW you have to make 4L in total, so lets say you have 4L in the 8L container and 3L in the 3L one, 
  you have to dump all the water out from the 3L container.
